Made by Tony Pallone

A program that gets the users password on initial startup then keeps it in memory for "locking" and "unlocking" as it were.

Programmed and implemented on a Atmega328P using a 8x2 LCD and a 3x4 keypad.

Video of it working will be up on my youtube channel and will be linked here later.
